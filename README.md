# Culinnari
Culinnari is a recipe sharing platform created as part of my Capstone Project using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The goal of this project was to create a simple platform that focuses back on the food instead of having to read through the recipe author's life story. This was my first code-only web development project. 

## Features
- User authentication (login/signup/logout)
- Create, view, and delete recipes
- Upload recipe image
- Search recipes by categories, total time, recipe name/description, recipe difficulty. 
- Sort recipe searches by post date, name, or rating value.
- Create cookbook and save recipes into cookbook
- Responsive design (400px - 1300px) 

## Tech Stack
- Backend: PHP (OOP), MySQL
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Database: MySQL
- Other Tools: dbdiagram.io (ERD/schema design)
## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```` bash
   git clone 
2. **Import the database**

3. **Configure the database connection**
    Update the database credentials in /private/initialize.php. 
4. **Set up server environment**
    Make sure you're running a local server (ex: XAMPP, MAMP, WAMP) and that PHP is enabled. I used Laragon for this project. 

## Project Structure
